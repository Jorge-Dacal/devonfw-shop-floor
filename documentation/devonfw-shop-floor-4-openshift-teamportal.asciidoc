The *Team Portal* is an Angular application that serves as entry point for the whole *OpenShift cluster* of the *devonfw-shop-floor 4 OpenShift*. The application is divided in two tabs: *CICD Services* and *My Apps*

== CICD Services

The development is intended to follow this original design:

== My Apps

In this tab of the application you will be able to deploy your Apps in the cluster by just pasting the URL of the RAW `openshift.json` file of your project:
