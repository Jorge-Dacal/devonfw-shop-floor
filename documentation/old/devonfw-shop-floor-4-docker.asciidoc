The *Docker* part of the shop floor is created based on the experience of the environment setup of the project *Mirabaud Advisory*, and intended to be updated to latest versions. Mirabaud Advisory is a web service developed with Devonfw (Java) that, alongside its own implementation, it needed an environment both for the team to follow CICD rules through their 1-week-long sprints and for the client (Mirabaud) to check the already done work.

Once the Docker part of the *devonfw-shop-floor* is generalized, it ends up offering 2 assets (plus one from the *devonfw-shop-floor-4-pl*: Jenkinsfiles):

At the end of the environment installation, you should have an architecture like this:

== 1. Documentation

The *devonfw-shop-floor* for *Docker* won't integrate all services for you. It's just intended to actually create them for you (Jenkins, GitLab, Nexus, etc.) in Docker containers, but the integration part must be do by yourself.

This is the goal for the documentation, and it can be visited from link:devonfw-shop-floor-4-docker-service-integration[here].

== 2. docker-compose.yml

This file is the *devonfw-shop-flor 4 Docker* itself. Executing it (ideally in your remote machine for CICD):

`# docker-compose up -d`

All services will be accessible via the `nginx-proxy` service (also included in the file) by writing in your browser something like:

```
http://jenkins.${YOUR_SERVER_IP}.nip.io
```
```
http://nexus.${YOUR_SERVER_IP}.nip.io
```
```
http://gitlab.${YOUR_SERVER_IP}.nip.io
```

== 3. Jenkinsfile(s)

After the correct set up following the documentation, link:https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-shop-floor/tree/master/dsf4pl/jenkins[both 2 Jenkinsfile(s)] for the *devonfw shop floor 4 Production Line* would also fit into your new Docker environment.
