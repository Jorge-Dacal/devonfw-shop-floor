The *devonfw-shop-floor 4 OpenShift* is a solution based on the experience of priming Devonfw for OpenShift by RedHat.

= Description

The complete OpenShift part of the *devonfw-shop-floor* involves several assets that will serve both from the point of view of creating the cluster and for the point of view of using it in *devonfw* projects.

== Documentation

These docs will serve as a user guide both for cluster admins and developers that actively use the environment.

=== Cluster Admins

How to set up the OpenShift Origin Cluster:

* Prerequisites (tools installed in remote machine) link:devonfw-shop-floor-4-openshift-how-to-install[How to install] Openshift Origin.
* link:devonfw-shop-floor-4-openshift-customize[Customize Openshift] to show the DevonFW in the catalog with icons.
* Execute https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devonfw/devonfw-shop-floor/master/dsf4openshift/openshift-cluster-setup/initial-setup/initial-setup.sh[initial-setup.sh] script
* Install all CICD services in the cluster

=== Developers

How to use the complete environment during development.

== OpenShift scripts

Both 2 will create the complete environment by creating the cluster, the DevonFW project and by installing every needed CICD service.

////
== Team Portal

The *Team Portal* is an application that it's installed in the cluster with previous scripts that is intended to be use by every user. It contains options of quick-access to all services and an acceleration of the deployment by using this app instead of entering to the OpenShift dashboard and do it by yourself.
////

== s2i Assets

Those assets will image streams in the cluster to easily and quickly deploy apps on it. Those are used by the *DevonFW* applications.

////
== openshift param file

This is the file that must be included in the root directory of the project you're going to deploy in the OpenShift cluster. It contains parameters that will be used by the *Team Portal* at the time of deployment (usually filled by someone with high role in the team i.e. a Team Leader).
